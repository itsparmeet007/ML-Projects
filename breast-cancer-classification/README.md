# Breast Cancer Classification

# Overview

This project classifies breast tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning. The goal is to assist in accurate diagnosis based on diagnostic features.

# Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Features include measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

Target: diagnosis (M = Malignant, B = Benign)

Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn for machine learning

# Approach
 
Data Preprocessing

Feature scaling and encoding

Train-Test Split

Dataset split into training and testing sets

Modeling

Random Forest Classifier used for prediction

Evaluation

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy)

# How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ML-project.git


Navigate to the project folder:

cd "ML project/Breast Cancer Classification"


Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab and run all cells.
